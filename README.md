## Description

GfyCatnip is an Android application that organizes your favorite animated GIFs for use later on messaging and social media, in the hopes of using it later, at the right time!

GfyCatnip makes use of Gfycat's API to create and manage animated GIFs for later usage with GfyCatnip. In addition, popular Android libraries such as Dagger 2, Retrofit 2, Butterknife, and Realm were used during the development of GfyCatnip.
